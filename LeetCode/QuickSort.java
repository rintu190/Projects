// Complexity
// Time Complexity:

// Best Case: (Ω(n log n)), Occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.
// Average Case (θ(n log n)), On average, the pivot divides the array into two parts, but not necessarily equal.
// Worst Case: (O(n²)), Occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (e.g., sorted arrays).
// Auxiliary Space: O(n), due to recursive call stack

// Process
// QuickSort works on the principle of divide and conquer, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

// There are mainly three steps in the algorithm:

// Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can vary (e.g., first element, last element, random element, or median).
// Partition the Array: Rearrange the array around the pivot. After partitioning, all elements smaller than the pivot will be on its left, 
// and all elements greater than the pivot will be on its right. The pivot is then in its correct position, and we obtain the index of the pivot.
// Recursively Call: Recursively apply the same process to the two partitioned sub-arrays (left and right of the pivot).
// Base Case: The recursion stops when there is only one element left in the sub-array, as a single element is already sorted.

// Choice of Pivot
// Always pick the first (or last) element as a pivot. The below implementation is picks the last element as pivot.
//  The problem with this approach is it ends up in the worst case when array is already sorted.
// Pick a random element as a pivot. This is a preferred approach because it does not have a pattern for which the worst case happens.
// Pick the median element is pivot. This is an ideal approach in terms of time complexity as we can find median in linear time and 
// the partition function will always divide the input array into two halves. But it is low on average as median finding has high constants.

// Partition Algorithm
// Naive Partition: Here we create copy of the array. First put all smaller elements and then all greater.
//  Finally we copy the temporary array back to original array. This requires O(n) extra space.
// Lomuto Partition: We have used this partition in this article. This is a simple algorithm, we keep track of index of smaller elements and keep swapping.
//  We have used it here in this article because of its simplicity.
// Hoare’s Partition: This is the fastest of all. Here we traverse array from both sides and keep swapping greater element on left with smaller on right 
// while the array is not partitioned. Please refer Hoare’s vs Lomuto for details.
